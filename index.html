        <h2><em><strong>Autonomous Vehicle Operator at Outrider</strong></em></h2>
        <p>
          I am an Autonomous Vehicle Test Operator at <strong><a href="https://www.outrider.ai/">Outrider</a></strong>
          that helps test, operate, maintain, and evaluate the Outrider System. This is a first-of-its-kind product
          designed to automate the world's largest distribution yards.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also held a number of different management, individual contributer, and operations positions in high technology
          including Global Supply Chain Director, Principle Supply Manager, and Quality Engineer supporting manufacturing, automation development,
          test development, information technology, marketing, facilities, and construction. I was layed off in 2017 and began training as an over the road truck driver,
          working across the 48 states with over 250K safe driving miles.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2022, and working at Outrider, I decided to improve my education and completed a basic Linux course.  I am currently training in Linux Administration, have entered a Web Development bootcamp to learn to code
        and become a full stack web developer (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, Github, Node, React, MongoDB, Web3,
        Blockchain, NFT minting, buying, selling and DAapps). Future classes in 2022 will include Bash shell scripting and python programming,
        as well as IOS App development.

  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>
    I am a results-oriented individual who performs best when I am working within a team environment. I enjoy being part of a team that is working toward meaningful goals that benefit both the
    company and the world we live in. I try to involve myself with associates who focus on what can be done, and desire to work together to achieve positive change. I hope to use my Transportation
    and High Technology experience to work toward a better future in the Transportation Industry.
  </p>
  <p> I am also a photographer who is inspired by nature, travel, culture, and urban living. I have an adventurous spirit and have traveled extensively in Asia, parts of Europe, and North America.
    Working with different cultures has developed an appreciation for diverse cultures and views.  Based in Colorado, I have tended to concentrate my photography on nature, landscape, & wildlife
    (dompierphoto.picfair.com). In 2022, I am working on developing my information technology skills toward web development, application development, and programming as well as Web3 and NFT's.
